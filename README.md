# Snake

Snake.py : Snake game but problem with the movements of the snake (only moves when a key is pressed/unpressed but not in between)
Snake_sol.py : Same game which works and with a few added features (speed increases with the length of the snake, added cubes change color...)

But always this error message "video system not initialized" which I do not know how to resolve (sys.exit(), pygame.init()...)
